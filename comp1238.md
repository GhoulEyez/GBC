# **Week 1 - Historical Introduction to Text and Writing**
<BR>

# Historical Context of Writing
## Early Writing Systems
- **Pre-Writing:**
   - 30,000 years ago: Cave paintings (e.g., rhinos in France).
   -20,000 years ago: Ishango bone with tally marks.
- **First Writing:**
   - ~5,000 years ago: Clay tablets in Mesopotamia (e.g., Uruk).
   - Cuneiform: Wedge-shaped marks pressed into clay.
   - Used for practical records like receipts (e.g., barley and beer).
# Development of Printing
## Early Printing Techniques
- **Cylinder Seals:** Used in Mesopotamia for stamping.
- **Woodblock Printing:** Old wood-block print dated 868 AD in the text itself (Diamond Sutra).
## Movable Type
- **Invention:** Enabled rearranging characters for different texts.
- **Gutenberg Press:** Revolutionized printing with metal movable type.
    - Gutenberg Bible: Luxury item, 180 copies produced.
## Impact of Printing
- **Economic:** Drastically reduced book prices.
- **Cultural:** Facilitated Renaissance and Reformation.
# Modern Writing Systems
## Alphabet Development
- **Phoenician Alphabet:** Ancestor of many modern alphabets.
- **Independent Systems:** Chinese, Mesoamerican, and others.
## Typewriters and Keyboards
- **Purpose:** Standardize text appearance, especially in business.
- **Monospace Fonts:** Developed for typewriters, used in coding.

# **Week 2 - Bits And Bytes**
## Binary Systems
- **Bit:** Short for binary digit, represents one of two states (0 or 1).
- **Byte:** Group of 8 bits.
- **Binary Numbers:** Numbers represented using base 2.
## Memory Types
- **Volatile Memory:** Loses data when power is off (e.g., RAM).
- **Non-Volatile Memory:** Retains data without power (e.g., SSD, HDD).
## Text Representation 
- **ASCII Table:** Maps numbers to characters (e.g., 65 for 'A').
- **Control Codes:** Non-printable characters for control functions (e.g., newline).
## File Types
- **Text Files:** Interpreted as characters using ASCII.
- **Binary Files:** Not intended to be read as text.
<BR>

# **Week 3 - Structure Of Text**
## Markup Languages
- **Markdown:**
Simple syntax for formatting.
Titles: # Title, ## Subtitle
Italic: _italic_
Bold: **bold**
Lists: * item or - item
Rendering: Conversion from raw text to formatted view.

- **HTML:**
More verbose than Markdown.
Tags: \<ul>, \<li>, \<p>, \<strong>, \<h1>, \<h2>, \<h3>
## Special Characters And Escaping
- **Special Characters:**
Non-alphanumeric symbols like @, #, $, &, *.
Escape sequences prevent special interpretation.
Example: \\# to display # in Markdown.
- **HTML Escaping:**
Use \&lt; for <, \&gt; for >, \&amp; for &.

# **Week 4 - Manipulating Text And Text Editors**
## Keyboard Mastery
- **Importance:** Efficient typing reduces cognitive load.
- **Types:**
Standard 104-key layout.
Variants like split, vertical, and ortholinear keyboards.
- **Layouts:**
QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak.
- **Modifier Keys:** modify the behavior of other keys - Control, Shift, Alt etc.
Touch Typing: Encouraged for efficiency and reduced fatigue.
## Text Editors
- **Types:**
Word Processors (e.g., Microsoft Word) vs. Text Editors (e.g., Notepad).
- **Popular Editors:**
   - Vim: Command-line based, requires learning commands.
      - Exit command: :q!
   - Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Widely used, feature-rich.
      - Extensions and themes available.
- **IDEs:** Integrated Development Environments like WebStorm, Pycharm.
## Search Techniques
- **Basic Search:** Use Ctrl + F for finding text.
- **Advanced Search:**
   Wildcards: Use * for any character sequence.
   Regex (Regular Expressions): For pattern matching.
      Example: line\d+ finds "line" followed by digits.
  ## GitHub Pages
- **Purpose:** Host web pages directly from GitHub repositories.
- **Setup:** Modify repository settings to enable GitHub Pages.
- **Themes:** Customize appearance using themes in _config.yml.

# **Week 5 - Command Line Interfaces**
## Introduction to Command Line Interfaces (CLI)
- **History and Evolution:**
   - Originated from teletype machines connected to computers.
   - Commands were typed and printed on paper, later replaced by screens.
   - Commands are often short due to historical reasons.
 ## Modern CLI Usage
- **Advantages:**
    - Some functionalities are only available via CLI.
    - Faster for certain tasks compared to graphical interfaces.
    - Easier automation through scripting.
    - Efficient for remote work with low bandwidth requirements.
    - Minimal resource usage on computers.
## Basic CLI Commands
- **Navigation and File Management:**

   - ls: List files in a directory.
   - cd: Change directory.
   - pwd: Print working directory.
   - cat: Display file contents.
   - less: View file contents interactively.
   - cp: Copy files.
   - mv: Move files.
   - mkdir: Create a directory.
   - ping: Test network connectivity.
- **Advanced Commands:**
    - grep: Search text using patterns.
    - Redirection and piping: Direct output to files or other commands.

  # **Week 6 - Git, GitHub, Diff, and Versioning**
## Introduction to Version Control
- **Version Control Systems (VCS):** Tools to manage changes in projects.
   -Essential in software development, engineering, legal documents.
- **Challenges:** Managing multiple versions, avoiding confusion with outdated versions.
## Git and GitHub
- **Git:**
  - Open-source tool for version control.
  - Installed locally to manage files on your disk.
  - Developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005.
- **GitHub:**
  - Cloud service for hosting Git repositories.
  - Provides additional features like web-based editing.
  - Owned by Microsoft.
 ## Basic Git Workflow
1. - **Clone:** Copy a remote repository to your local machine.
2. - **Pull:** Retrieve the latest changes from the remote repository.
3. - **Modify:** Edit files locally.
4. - **Commit:** Save changes to your local repository.
        - git commit -m "commit message"
5. - **Push:** Upload changes to the remote repository.
## Diff and Patch
- **Diff Tool:** Compares two files to highlight differences.
     - Example command: diff file1.txt file2.txt
- **Patch Files:** Describe changes to apply to files.
## Tools and Commands
- **Command Line Client:** Uniform across different systems.
- **VS Code Integration:** Recommended for beginners.
- **Git Commands:**
   - git clone \<repo-url>: Clone a repository.
   - git pull: Update local repo with remote changes.
   - git push: Upload local changes to remote repo.
   - git commit -m "message": Commit changes with a message.
